Students: They want to be able to create and manage their own degree plan. This involves adding, editing, and saving their degree plan. They feel that the current one is impossible to complete due to limited seats within the classes and genuinely fail to follow it within their 4 years at UD. They want to be able to go back and edit their degree plan to make sure they're still on track to graduate on time even after taking their courses not in order.
Academic Advisors/Teachers: They want to have the students decided their own path while guiding them to inculde the nessecary courses required. They want access to go over and review their choices and make reccomendations where ever they're needed.
Dr.Bart: He wants us to make software and lots of it!!! However he's looking for it to not be too complicated. Simple easy software is the main goal along side the whole thing working in genereal. Looking for everything he asked us to work and preform according to the code, and to make it easy to read for any outsiders trying to improve upon the website themselves.
